# Windows 2000 Minesweeper Clone

---

The good old pre-installed Minesweeper was sent to heaven since Windows 8. To show my deepest respect to my very-first PC game, I decided to clone the Minesweeper with Windows 2000 UI. To have the best gaming experience, I strongly recommend that you should play in the office and hide it when your boss passby. Why? Coz we did the similar things when our teachers pass by during computer lesson in 1st grade!
